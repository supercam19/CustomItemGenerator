# Minecraft Custom Item Generator
This website allows you to easily create new Minecraft items within datapacks. These custom items have lore and name options, aswell as built-in right-click detection, hit detection, and kill detection.

## Installing a datapack
Once you have configured all the options for your item and are ready to put it in game, press the Download Datapack button in the bottom right of the website. Save this file into your worldfolder/datapacks folder, just like any other datapack. You can give yourself the item you added by typing 

`/function {item_name}:give`

(replace {item_name} with what you named your item, but remember that spaces are replaced with underscores)
This will give you the item in game, and everything is done!
